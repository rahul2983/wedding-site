  <p>Their Story ... She LOVES SRK and He hates her. OMG!! How could these two ever get together? Well, here is how - it is the ONLY major thing that they disagree on and they are virtually the same people otherwise. Both disagree with the idea of marriage (and finally agreed only for their parents), both love or wish to travel the world, 'Tension Nako' is their motto, they can never ever stop eating chicken. Their dads share the same sunsign, their bdays fall in the same month, they went to the same school in Mumbai - the right question should be - How are these two never get together?</p>
